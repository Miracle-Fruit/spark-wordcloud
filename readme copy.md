### ToDo's
* PDF/Architekturplan (draw.io) Ã¼berarbeiten
* run df_job von flask (button im frontend)
* PrÃ¤sentations Video


### Problems
* Read and write in the same sparkjob -> can cache the table 
* special character are not correcly saved in database -> change char_set and collate to utf-8
* queries in sql are sometimes not so easy 
* bootstrap elemente center -> frontend sucked
* setup with database and JDBC-driver -> link driver by spark-submit and in docker-image
* docker setup with all componands -> try and error until its works
* spark-jobs depands strongly on systems hardware  e.g. 4MB .txt-file  PC ->  11-20sec, laptop -> 2-3min
